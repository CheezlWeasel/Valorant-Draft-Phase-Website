# Valorant-Draft-Phase-Website
The valorant draft phase is an idea that originated from the streamer wattstermatter, the idea is to have a league of legends style banning and picking phase for agents, however the main difference being that each agent could only be picked once (if viper is picked by team 1 team 2 cannot then pick viper, neither can pick from the bans pool)
This upgrade will include a lobby system as it becomes a public tool AND will include a map ban system that CAN be used independently
